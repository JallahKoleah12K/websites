        <h1>Inline Elements</h1>
        <!--content starts below here-->
        <p>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph or division.
            Each element does different things to the text. <strong>This is in a strong element.</strong> <b>This text is in a bold (b) element.</b>
            Bold and strong seem to have the effect. <em>This is emphasised (em) text.</em> It seem to look the same as this <i>italicized text here.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Putting text inside quote elements, <q>like this quote text here</q>, makes the text display with quotation marks around it.
            Code (code) tags are meant for source code examples. they look like <code>code text here.</code> The keyboard element (kbd) looks the same, <kbd>keyboard text here,</kbd>
            but is meant for examples of user entered data.
        </p>
        <p>Superscrip and subscript elements to what they say. <sup>this is superscript</sup> and <sub>this is subscript.</sub></p>
        <span>Span elements don't seem to do anything at all. I've put about every other inside span tags. Can you tell which is which?</span>
