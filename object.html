        <h2>This Land Is Your Land</h2>
        <p>by Woody Guthrie</p>
        <p>
        This land is your land this land is my land<br> From California to the New York  island;<br>
        From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters<br>This land was made for you and Me.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I was walking that ribbon of highway,<br>
            I saw above me that endless skyway:<br>
            I saw below me that golden valley:<br>
            This land was made for you and me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps<br> To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts;<br>
            And all around me a voice was sounding:<br> This land was made for you and me.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the sun came shining, and I was strolling,<br>
            And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,<br>
            As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:<br>
            This land was made for you and me.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I went walking I saw a sign there<br>
            And on the sign it said <q>No Trespassing.</q><br>
            But on the other side it didn't say nothing,<br>
            That side was made for you and me.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,<br>
            By the relief office I seen my people;<br>
            As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking<br>
            Is this land made for you and me?
        </p>
        <p>
            Nobody living can ever stop me,<br>
            As I go walking that freedom highway;<br>
            Nobody living can ever make me turn back<br>
            This land was made for you and me.
